## 🌐 Introduction

The **Openly Real-Time Catastrophe Impact Simulator** is an open-source analytics platform designed for insurance risk managers, actuaries, and finance teams.  
It empowers proactive catastrophe impact modeling, exposure benchmarking, and real-time solvency stress-testing—critical for regulatory compliance, capital planning, and agent-driven business growth.


**Core objectives:**
- **Transparent** and **reproducible** catastrophe event simulations.
- **Agent-level exposure analytics** for granular risk management.
- **Integrated dashboards** for executive and operational decision-making.

## 📊 Features

### Financial Risk & Catastrophe Modeling
- **Catastrophe Loss Simulation:** Gross/net claim payout estimates by region, severity, and coverage type.
- **Risk Benchmarking:** Regional risk heatmaps, solvency ratios, and emerging threat detection.
- **Capital Adequacy:** Scenario and Monte Carlo stress-testing for capital reserves.
- **Reserve Adequacy:** Real-time calculation of reserve sufficiency under catastrophic scenarios.

### Business & Agent Analytics
- **Agent Exposure:** Track portfolio concentration, growth opportunities, and high-risk regions.
- **Claims Delay Prediction:** Machine-driven forecasts of potential settlement delays for cash flow optimization.
- **What-If Scenario Planning:** Rapidly assess the impact of changes in event severity, policy coverage, or reinsurance terms.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Power BI** – Executive-level risk, capital, and business dashboards.
- **Python** – Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn for data cleaning, modeling, and predictive analytics.
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Transparent, auditable workflows for all analytics.
- **CSV/Excel** – Realistic mock and production-ready datasets for demonstration and testing.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** – Advanced data visualization and reporting.
